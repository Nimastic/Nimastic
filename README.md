## 👨‍💻 My Coding Journey 
   I started my "coding" journey at 7 using Lego Mindstorm Block Programming during my time at Robotics Club. In that 10 years, I've learned to build and code: a ball colour sorter, competitive sumo bots, light/line-tracing vehicles, a bipedal robot, and many other projects. In Junior College, I attended multiple workshops on game development, building my 3rd Person Shooter using Unity3D. I entered the world of Computer Science right after my National Service as I wanted to learn everything I could about this programming world, all while building my first mobile application, an iOS To-Do-List app, and thereafter a basic workout mobile application as an additional value-point for my small eCommerce business. I've since been a Frontend Developer for my residence at NUS Sheares Hall Residence, and a Software Developer for a start-up called OmegaCity. If you have any opportunities or would like to network do let me know! :)
